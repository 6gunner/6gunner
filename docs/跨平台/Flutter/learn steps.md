1. [Widget fundamentals](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/fundamentals/widgets) Learn about one of the primary building blocks of a Flutter application, widgets.
2. [Layout](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/fundamentals/layout) Flutter is different from other UI frameworks in that you create the layout programmatically. This allows you to compose widgets, Flutter's basic building blocks, to realize your own layout vision. It also facilitates designing a UI to optimize any screen where your app might be used.
3. [State management](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/fundamentals/state-management) Learn how to share state between widgets and notify other parts of your app when the state changes. See how to implement MVVM in Flutter to manage state effectively for small to medium-sized apps.
4. [Handling user input](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/fundamentals/user-input) Learn about Flutter's widgets that support interactivity, like buttons and text. Also, learn how to add interactivity to a widget that doesn't already support it.
5. [Networking and data](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/fundamentals/networking) Networking is a very large topic, so this section focuses on basic networking functionality, such as how to retrieve or submit data using HTTP, how to convert to and from JSON, how to use authentication, how to implement asynchronicity, and more.
6. [Local data and caching](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/fundamentals/local-caching) Learn about different techniques for caching local data.
